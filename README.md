•	This Python project utilizes OpenCV to implement real-time license plate detection and recognition. It leverages a pre-trained Haarcascade model specialized in identifying license plate features. 
•	The system captures live video from a webcam, analyzing each frame to detect and highlight license plates. Users can save detected plates by pressing 's', facilitating further analysis or archiving. 
•	This project serves as a fundamental building block for applications such as vehicle tracking and automated toll collection systems.
